# atom-autocomplete-jsdoc

Offers suggestions for JSDoc keywords.

Once installed, you should automatically get suggestions for JSDoc keywords inside documentation blocks whenever you type `@` followed by any character. The keywords and their descriptions were scraped from [the JSDoc website](http://usejsdoc.org).

## TODO

* Add a snippet for each keyword, or at least for the most common ones.
* Integrate into [Docblockr](https://atom.io/packages/docblockr)?
